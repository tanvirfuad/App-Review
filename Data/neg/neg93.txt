Please fix. I'm using Android and have purchased recipe pack 1  4. My problem is pack 1 doesn't work except for the pizza recipe. Keeps giving me an error message due to network failure or other error processing has been cancelled. Please explain to me why this is happening while recipe pack 4 works perfectly wo giving me error. I have already reset my phone as well as my router, turned offon my wifi. FIX THIS PLEASE AND GIVE ME MY MONEY'S WORTH.
Eh. I would rate higher but my only problem is that you only get a few recipes and then have to purchase the rest. That kind of sucks. Unistall.
FIX THE POTATO SHAKING On special mode you dont have enough time to finish the thing. I'm always off by four shakes or so. Please fix that. Because if you go too fast the bag gets thrown and I'm going as fast as you can without it being thrown so please fix
It was good till.. Here I thought, ohmg, I'm going to be able to make so many dishes. The most you can make Is 6. And the rest you have to pay. Not worth the time installing or the memory.
