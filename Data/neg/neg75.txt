It's supposed to be a two way relationship. Haven't yet seen the game. First you asked me to sign up, google, fb, whatever, you're interested in my connections. Fair enough, you're offering me a supposedly free fun game. But then you asked me to except several terms and conditions agreements, now, i haven't yet seen the game. I don't know what I'm getting in exchange for my privacy. At that point is decided to bail out. Too bad.
