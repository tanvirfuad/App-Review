Game freezes after latest update
Lost all progress Have been playing for a bit.  Was up to lvl 250 something last night and woke up this morning haviing to start all over.  Any way to fix
Ugh This is the 3 time i have to reset the game after i get to a certain level it force closes and doesnt let me open the game unless i reset it i love the game but how many times will this happen
Steals lives Every time I am close to beating this level it force closes, so I loose my life and beans. Needs to all be replaced.
It crashes very often Whenever I try to play, it crashes I like the game, it's interesting, but can't play because of instant crashing  What's the problem
Farm heroes It keeps kicking me out the game Doing my absolutele tree in
