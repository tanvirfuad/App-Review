Waste of Resources Leaves a service running 247 and restarts it if you stop it, a complete waste of resources even assuming it's not doing something nefarious, like compromising your privacy, which I can't prove. Uninstalled.
I hate it It took a pic of my sis in the kitchen when you feed him telling my sis to delete the game now ps it dose it when you exit
