App needs a lot of fixing Crashes not downloading my surah. Mainly Salman al utabyi. Pls answer
Avoid, installs malware This app installs malware. After installing it brings up ads on your home screen at random intervals during the day. They will not go away. Avoid and use ad free altervatives. If you as the developer need to generate income, release a paid, ad free version this is not a sensible way to to collect revenue.
