IAPs in the paid app The game has become more convoluted with coins, stats and ink etc I don't care about. I would like to disable all these extra's. Ruzzle doesn't work on the Zenfone2.
Paid for ad free upgrade...has ads I paid to get the upgrade which MAG says does not have ads. But they have games sponsored by ATT which u are not able to delete. The ATT game does not count toward any ranking and you don't not compete with anybody. It only goes away after you find the 5 words ATT tells you to find. Those 5 words make up an advertisement for ATT. So, I have to look at the ATT logo everytime I play. Very annoying
I've been playing RUZZLE for over two year's now. I have experienced many of the kinks that others have had. However, now my letters are not connecting Not sure what the problem is but please fix this My stats are suffering each game I have a Galaxy Note 4. This should not be happening. HELP
Stuck on level 20 Update Issue still has not been resolved and have not heard back from support.                                                Had to change from a 5 to a 1. I've been stuck on level 20 no matter how many games I've played.  Sent an email to support. Will change rating when resolved.  I know I should be on level 30, at least, by now
