Terrorist or nah Every other puzzle it says things like bombing, terror, Iraqi, death. These are the only repetitive words, as I've seen them about 15 times a piece. Y'all need to get a handle on that or I can definitely find a word search app that's better and doesn't make me feel like my life's in danger and these are warnings. Ridiculous.
Just okay Nothing wowed me about this app. It's just average. Runs well with no glitches, just very simple and uninteresting.
