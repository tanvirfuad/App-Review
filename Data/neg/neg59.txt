It's messing up the free ball for watching ads again... lv 167 only have 2 balls instead of 9 after watching ad When its not messing up    Neat power ups and game play, the only issue I've experienced is an occasional error in video playback when I've selected the option to view an ad for a free ball. Plus I've been stuck on a level for months, getting to the point I'm more frustrated than entertained, hopefully I'll pass it soon Recommend if you enjoy these types of games.
Rather then having a tutorial for level 43 make the level a little easier. I'm uninstall just for that reason.  Thought the game was good but I'm stuck  sucks
Seems funny. Before you log into Facebook it tries enticing you to connect by saying you score in the top 5 then after you do connect it never happens again. Also it seems to purposely make you fail each level not always but more so then not the first time. I guess to blow through your lives. Also a 1 min. Vid only gives you 1 ball.. gonna uninstall.
Please Fix Ok I emailed you but problem is not fixed ads are still not working
