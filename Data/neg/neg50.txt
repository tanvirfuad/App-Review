Won't work I don't like it. It keeps freezing and then says it is not respondng. It says that for every time I wanna play it. The game in general is great but it just is not working out for me.
Cant play Whenever I open up the app the screen freezes in static and doesnt do anything. It doesnt effect the phone itself but the app simply doesnt do anything.
