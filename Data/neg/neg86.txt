Broken Revenue Issues 1 the game requires you to have cash to sign people. That's not right as the salary comes out over the course of the season. But if you want to sign a guy to a 5M contact you have to have AND USE 5M cash even if you have salary cap. 2 you don't make money like you should. Unless you go deep in the playoffs you end up losing money. 3 save game corrupted and no help from developer.  Please fix these issues.

Draft picks Awesome game but still having trouble with draft picks losing position and number despite the update.  this time it was 2 of the 3 draft picks from the regular draft but only of the 3 draft picks that I scouted and each one shows NAN in place of passing and ball security stats, giving them values of zero
