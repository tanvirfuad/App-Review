Gloria Has too many bugs that need fixed. Uninstatlling. Found the exact same probe on candy frenzy 2, so uninstalled it also. Please let me know when you think you have the mistakes fixed and I will try it one more time and that will be the end for me if bugs are still there. exact samr
Galaxy tab Can u do something about ur timer levels how do u expect pple to put away 9 candies among all that hard glass in 2mins it will be a lot easier are aligned in d right places damn
838 still too hard Way way too hard... Just eliminate all the freeking timing stuff and regeneration of blocks EVERYWHERE.   You're losing players because everyone wants to win... But it's too hard
I got level 30 and it frozz then started over and didn't give it to me.
Can't get it to unfreeze Tried Uninstalling and reinstalling, but it started me all over, and finally got to my level and it's froze AGAIN
WAY TO MANY ADDS. SOME LEVELS CAN TAKE DAYS TO FINISH..
Back to start Signed in with account and took me back to the very start. Not cool
Help Stuck on Castle 31 any hints how to get through
Loved it before latest update HATE all the new video ads you are FORCING us to watch...about ready to uninstall. I don't want to watch all these videos...you already have ads running during the entire game at the bottom of the screen...are these really necessary
Love it I really love this game it's challenging but it's just to challenging, I am stuck on 30 it's impossible to get all the blocks and all the fruit before u run out of time and the update sucks now I have to watch a video. And really only 10 extra seconds and only if u download another game. Sorry but I think I will uninstall this game now. Good game bad timing.
Stuck I have been stuck on 418 for 3 months. I've tried everything and can't get passed it.
Stucked at level 30, can't skip, no point continue playing
