Can't see landscape I can't see the landscape while playing. After my shot hits the land that slides down is the only part that is visible. Makes it very tricky to play
Disappointed I used to love playing this game back in high school. I was excited when i saw it for mobile phones but what's the point if it doesn't even make it past the very first loading screen I am very disappointed that i wasted my time even trying this.
Notification sound Yeah, nice one devs. Unwanted update to make the notification sound ridiculous and obtrusive. Just what we wanted. Why is it so loud  awful compared to other notifications Also, the game fails to connect to the server constantly either since an update or since I moved to lollipop.
Sucks Wtf When I start the game the green hill is invisible and I can't play.  But in my aunts mobile its working fine
