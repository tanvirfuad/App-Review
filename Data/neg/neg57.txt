I Can Pass Between running out of lives  so quickly  having to purchase stuff just 2 stay in the game, I can pass on this one . Besides, there are quite a few games like this whereas u get more playing time. Uninstall
Would be better I'm on level 84 if you gave more options through the game would be better. I've had so many no more moves that it's making the game unenjoyable and makes it very irratating when you only have 20 move to free 8 clams, get 80 blues and 60 greens on top making sure a shark doesn't eat one of them 
No good... runs out of life very quickly... interesting to an extent.. having to purchase things is not at all interesting... getting stuck in one level..level 63 .. makes one lose interest... there are better games in this kind to play...
Over and over I liked this when I started,  but I have tried level 54 so many times I've lost track. The only possibility is to pay for boosts.
Fish smasher This game has problems . sorry  unless this is fixed.   You will never get past  62. So I have to give this. 1 star.
Don't instal it Game is pay to win. I have much XP in games like thisone, the game just dont want u to pass lvl if u dont buy powerups. The egv thig is shitty as fuck, and when u pop frozen fish, the ice just brokes, but fish stays. Trust me this game is shit.
Fish smasher At first i was so excited to play but when im on the next level.im so disappointed cos,i cant play..yhe words well appear ..no more lives how comei well uninstall it
not free Like all similar type of games ..allows you to get to a level .. then stops you ..unless you buy more moves ..level 63 is such a level ..impossible to complete with 35 moves.  Deleting
Cute game but since you see fit to make us wait for lives that cuts rating and your brain low
RIPPED ME OFF I paid for pearl twice and didn't get what I paid for   Then I got a msg purchase received.  Please give me  or pearls.  T
