It's Alright I didn' t like the part where I would loose but then wouldn't let me go to the level I was on. It would say get premium and I would but then it would be with money. Makes no sense when I could just download Smash Hit 2 .
Only money You need money for this game I know that yes the creators need money to develop new games but this is ridiculos. If you lose you need money to go to the last checkpoint if you press restart again same thing you need money...
Payments kill this This IS a great game but I don't like the fact that it requires payment even to save it at checkpoints
