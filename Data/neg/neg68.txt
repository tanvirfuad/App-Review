Boring and IMPOSSIBLE and PREDICTABLE The AI in this game is more predictable then a politician. You know your going to lose with odds worse then a casino. Lighten it up about 50000 levels. Iv had this game for years. But this AI winning 90 of the games is getting old real quick.
Whats gone wrong Had this on my Samsung Galaxy 2 and Asus Transformer for ages and played it loads and loads.  Still plays fine on the phone but keeps either giving me a blank screen or instead of letting me select a game goes back to the home page on the Asus.  Have deinstalled it and reloaded it twice, works for a couple of times then the same problem.  Otherwise really love this, help
OK, but not the best... It has many games but not enough options. For instance, it doesn't have a hint or autocomplete option. These two things would put it in the running for the best Solitaire app. As it stands, 250 Solitaire is the best Solitaire app. Wish I wouldn't have spent the money.
Cheating computer Love how many card games this app has. I'd love to give it five stars but it seems like the computers win more than you. Even solitaire games are impossible. C'mon. What a waste.. I've caught on to all the computer's tricks to win in Rummy and now I can win every time. But eukre is a different story. Wtf Worst 4 bucks I've ever spent
