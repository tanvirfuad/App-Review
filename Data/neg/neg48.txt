Pretty terrible port A few issues the  character  disappears at the bottom of the map. Most of the story from the original iOS version is completely missing. Also if you don't build huts, the story won't progress which cuts out a HUGE aspect of the original game. Also, you can suffer from thieves even when you haven't built a village. This version of the original game contains 90 of the mechanics of the original, but 10 of the heart.
Text is off the screen Everything about this game is good, only problem I have is that the text goes off the bottom of the screen, making it hard to read because it's replaced by other text fast. Please alter this, it would make it easier to read and reread what has happened so far like an ingame log.
Um ok then Well the text for the dusty path is stuck behind the stoke fire text and when I select the modest village text, the dusty path text is stuck behind the gather wood text so I can't even fully play the game. Well not stuck behind but it's kinda stuck inside the other texts. It is very annoying that I can't embark anymore.
Needs Work I can see that this has the potential to be an interesting game, but it seems to be messed up on my phone Moto E 2nd Gen.. The text is cut off at the bottom of the screen and there's no way to scroll down, so you pretty much just end up stuck after completing a few rudimentary tasks. Because of this, my gameplay experience was awful...hence the onestar rating.
Dis freakin boring All you do is look at a grey screen and read
Great game, but it bugs out like crazy. I'll go on the dirt trail and the game will bug, bring up the text about where I'm going and won't let me put it for. I'll have to exit the game to fix it but then all my stuff is gone. Will give 5 stars once the bugs are fixed
