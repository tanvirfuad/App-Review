BORING I think it was kind of boring. Once you build the houses and things you can't even go in them. The only thing I liked about it is t that you could change it's clothes. So that's why I gave it two stars.
You suck. It seems like yall made this JUST to annoy everybody else while the youngest in the family sits in the corner laughing. THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS GIVE THE OPTION TO TURN THE MUSIC OFF. I HATE THIS GAME, IT'S STUPID. THE MUSIC IS LIKE A 5 SECOND LOOP. IT'S ANNOYING. FIX IT.
I liked it also the Emmet LOGO was cool Cool
Bad game It stopt so much times  it dident save my coins
