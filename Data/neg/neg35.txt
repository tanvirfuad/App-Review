For years this app let my kids do things with PE that were complex and tough any other way. Now it's nothing more than an inventory editor which you can get better inventory editors for free. The world editing was something that they used all the time and now it just locks up and fails.   If the terrain editing ever gets fixed this app will be back to the best. For now though, it's not worth using. Other apps are better.
Used to be great. I used this app to make awesome structures, digging out huge mines. Unfortunately for a few versions now when you use the app for this purpose, it creates a lighting bug that is just awful. I used to love this app, now i never use it. Please fix the lighting issue
BUG CANT EDIT TERRAINS You know that i can now edit items on master mcpe,i bought this so i can edit terrain of my friend's world,it always stopped working but when i edit other map it does.
Keep failing Every time I want to make a change in my world, it kept saying 'saved failed'
Waste of money I would recommend MCPE Master it has all features and more for free and no ads.
