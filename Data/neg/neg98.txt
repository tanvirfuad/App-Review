Buggy , amateur attempt from big studio Can't place items when a mini fig character asks for an item trees , flowers etc. . quite disappointing , also no clear game direction , a welcome intro would be good welcome to .... Etc , the aim of the game is ..... , each island has ...... , new items  islands etc can be unlocked by ...... Considering Lego has a worldwide following and is huge I'd expect better from you this is amateur indie developer mistakes.
Palm tree issues... When creating a palm tree or any other small build the game will not let me determine where to place the object. I cannot get past one of the first parts of the game.
It was fun until today. The newest update is buggy and causes both frequent lag times on my Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and a serious power drain. If this continues, I'll be uninstalling.  UPDATE As of 1192015, it has only gotten worse. Now the islands aren't even accessible. Destined to be deleted.
Note 3 I enjoyed the game for what I could play of it. Add one for houses such as trees and grills cannot be moved. Also, the settings on the main menu asks you to hold for 2 seconds but it never worked for me. Wish this worked because it was entertaining.
It requested me to build something, but cant decide where to place and the lego seems that camt see my new decoration, keep requesting, it is very annoying
