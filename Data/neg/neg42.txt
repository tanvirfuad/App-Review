StupidIt You know I had become warden then I am still being call as prisoner and I didn't do anything I get kidnapped Dangit
VIP In my opinion this game almost forces you to buy the vip pass. I just lost my game progress becuase I was arrested for not buying the vip pass. Anyway this game sucks and I feel it is forcing you to buy there shetty game. Feck this.
It doesn't do anything after you create your person.just a black screen with a cell phone going off.it needs fixed
Why cops use things that there are not spouse to use and why cops are punching me and steal stuff from me and if I die they grab me and l live what kiang a game is this
Glitch I can't move after I serve my sentence and become a citizen, the game itsel is poorly developed and pathetic at its nature, this game disgusts me and doesen't even deserve 1 star
Disliked it The game got really annoying and slow pasted me as.The mostly unjust court rooms piling up daysfor the sentence.And the most stupidest thing was im murdering a cop with a knife...the game pauses for him to say put that knife down and he gets back up and has advantage again..
