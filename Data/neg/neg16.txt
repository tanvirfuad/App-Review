UPDATE logbook just consumed 512mb of data on 3g. 50 of my monthly allowance in 4days. i can see no reason for this.    Needs reminder scheduling for more than postprandia events. ie mealtimepilltime reminders. Also many diabetics with eye problems will not be able to read the text as it is far too low contrast. Otherwise very engaging,
