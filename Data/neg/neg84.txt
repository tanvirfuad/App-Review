Consumes too much space It consumes 246 mb of my phone storage, 3x more thn other online games like coc does. Plz fix this.
Pointless, mindless game... Just had to create multiple accounts and raid your own cities and soon you'll be the strongest depending on how much accounts you could create....
Bug When game hangs, then background music still playing after clearing cache and force stop game. I've to reboot to solve this problem. Plz fix this.
Doesn't work with phone simulators New update restricts usage to phones only. applications like Bluestacks will not work.
COK SUCKS new update is sucks . please fix this .. i cant open my account it was always force close . i will give 5 stars if you fix this ..
Someone needs to read the reports and fix them instead of automatic response bs that always says the same thing Game is great and love to play but its getting old that every other update makes it crash and you lose everything
Why I can not buy gold This version has problems time collecting resources for me is 258,389 days why
cosume too much space butt still love it 
Boring This is the most boring game I have ever played and there are plenty I just don't get the point of this stupid game. I am not amused.
It's not opening up Its boring boo
TOO MANY HACKERS they selling resources, spamming kingdom chat, even stealing your account.. since this is pvp games you will never win against cheaters..
