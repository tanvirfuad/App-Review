I don't need to see ads I'll delete every app I install if it has ads pop up. It's so annoying and actually make me never want to download the app they are advertising. I'll just stay with my phones alarm clock.
Saving to home screen I would give it 5 stars if someonebwould tell me how to use as homescreen,but havent even had an answer to my email asking how to do it.
The application was down loaded with the intention that it would have its own alarm tone But to my great astonishment it gave the same tone so it disappointed me most
CRASHES EVERY TIME I CLICK ON THE ICON This app should be called Awesome Crashing Clock because that is what it does each and every time I try to active the application.
DOESN'T WORK Every time I try and set an alarm it tells me it has stopped running.  I haven't got to use it once.  I've gotten no response when I tell you about it so I have no alternative but to delete it.
Can't get it to do landscape As I said if I could access settings perhaps landscape could be done but I see on access.  Otherwise it is good
Based on Googles Clock I was looking for a clock that allows more than 9 alarm sets throughout the week. Unfortunately this look at alarms is based on Google clock and has that same limit. It does look very good though.
Pretty But I wanted home screen clock,seems I need to click tiny widget,then massive clock fills screen,with scrolling ads running under it.
Voider All I want is a nice clock to look at to tell me the time and date without all the ad just tell me the time date when I need it
Explanation I would have given it 4 stars its pretty clock but no way to set wallpaper
