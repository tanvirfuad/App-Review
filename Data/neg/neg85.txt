Kingdom vs kingdom is the worst idea they came up with. Waste your time trying to get back to where you were. Don't bother playing unless you have a job that doesn't care about performance or if you have loads of money to spend to buy your way into the game. 4 stars if they pull their collective heads out of their rectums. 1 star for now. Play Hobbit or game of war. Better for players and shields don't cost you 3 weeks of signing in.
I worked up to having over five million of food and over two million in other resources. Then last night some stupid player name xenia attacked me sixteen times and wiped out everything I built up while I was asleep through the night. What is the point that you can be attacked sixteen times in one night by the same player. Im soooo peeved that I also spent money. I will never recommend anyone to play this game. DONT DOWNLOAD. And I would like my money back.
Loe Spent money for the arena event and now can't get back on game. server error 80011. Unable to play. Will be requesting refund or look for a new game. Sucks
