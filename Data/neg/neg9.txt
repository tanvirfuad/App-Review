Request for group video sending and receiving, plus the ability to add people in chats, and send files in groups, performance improvements and bug fixes To Microsoft
No sound The last update caused no sound issues during video call. It also causes two calls group call despite making just a single call
Instead of comstantly creating new interfaces, can you fix the app first Facebook users still cant even use this

Mic doesn't work for nexus 9
5050 I want to be able to enter other apps while in voice call
Several reasons They Removed Do not disturb status, there isn't group video chat. Push notifications are broken.
Galaxy S5        
It's terrible It crashes on open. I get all the notifications but when i tap them to open skype, it just crashes. When i try to launch the app by itself, it crashes. This isn't the experience I have on my mac desktop. This is just mediocre, worst app I have installed on my phone. One Plus 2 user.
Almost no use video chatting because my screen flashes and sometimes turns totally black
Doesn't after last update.
For the new update The new update is slightly better but it keeps crashing every time I do a video call please fix this
I hate this app What does it mean by details this app I don't like anymore hate it
