Please fix some issues I was very excited to play this game because of tons of positive reviews so I installed it right away. But the very first moment I opened the app, it crashed. I gave it a chance when it finally opened on my third try. When I was already playing some mini games, it crashed again. What happened Please fix the bugs. I'll still give it a try and might change my rating if it does not crash anymore. Thank you
I AM SO MAD I recently got a new phone and I cannot transfer the data How would I do this because I worked really hard.
