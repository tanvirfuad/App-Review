Was fun...now just a money grab Early levels were fun and challenging. They just added the new city and now you get so overwhelmed with zombies at the same time you can't pass the level without a power up which means you have to spend money to advance....no thanks. Play fair developer...it's good to make it challenging but now you are just a money suck. You won't get anything from me. Deleting the app now.
Could've been addicting.. It is interesting but frustrating.. adjusting the sensitivity doesnt help much plus the ads are annoying. Aiming is terrible considering some zombies pop right in front of you later on. The power ups are hard to earn unless you keep buying them. It was fun for the first few hours...so thanks and bye.
Wont run on note 4
The control is so shit. Every time I move my arrow around the whole thing exaggerates my movements, the sensitivity control doesn't help either
Gets very boring very quickly. Stupid adds at every interval, power ups like radar cost money. Just repetative and controls are awkward.
Not providing enough equipment Game is good and interesting but the worst part is game provides few times and radar. If you want to buy it you will have to pay cash from your pocket, i.e. from your credit card. And the zombies run fast and you can not kill them without these equipment.
