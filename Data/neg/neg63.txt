UPDATES Every time The app updates i lose all my stuff
it keeps exiting out for no reason.
Thanks for taking all of my spin bonuses away from me You guys suck horse nuts
Fun game Overall fun game, but when it's time to cross the bridge people don't get the requests to help. Contacted them, nothing. They want you to purchase their gold bars to move on or wait 70hrs to play again.
Since the update I can't play it. it goes to the title and crashes. Fix it and I will give you five stars but I rate one star until you have fixed it 
Love it Totally addicted
