Every parent with a child in High School and College must have this App Love how the search is streamlined for the student so that you avoid searching through scholarships that the student has nothing to do with.
Well worth it This app is great for helping to find scholarships fast As a high school senior, I've been able to find relevant scholarships faster and easier. Well worth the 99 cent investment. It would be cool if you would add an option that sorts through scholarships for other high school grade levels too. And yes I saw it on shark tank.
Great App Downloaded last night. Great source. Already found several good leads. I like having the option of saving and emailing the saved list to myself. Must have for all scholarship seekers I will be recommending to others
I know so many people who would be at much better places only if we knew about something like this when we graduated...
Love it to the fullest This is the Best App ever for CS like my littler sister whos now is in her second semester in school looking for funds.
My major isn't on there I am planning to major in actuarial science and my major isn't on there yet it requires me to complete all fields. Great app by the way
Shark tank Get more than 40,000 from them. App looks great
ExcellentTool This is an excellent application for any student desiring a college education, but who is concerned about the cost of tuition. This app is extremely easy to use, and very flexible. You can change your input criteria to help filter your scholarship options. I was amazed at the vast number of resources available to help fund education. Kudos to the developer, You ROCK
Scholly is a remarkable app This app is really good at finding scholarships that are trustworthy and insightful
I love it Very easy and useful. Searching for scholarships is a very long and difficult task at times.
