Amazing technology I signed some professional and sent it by email and put a photo on first page seemlessly and easily. Amazing thing without having to open up my laptop. I never knew this technology exist. God bless you guys I can only imagine what i can do on the premium version
Amazing I have been through a number of apps like this and this one takes the cake. So easy to use and does everything I could ever want it to. Perfection.
