Really loved this app until you changed the smily faces, the new ones are ugly,  please change them back the old one's are better and cute, not just that when I open the app it now takes longer to load and the same thing happens when I open a text message,  thinking about getting rid of the app.
We need need new updates I want new emojis, I don't care if the other people liked the Google emojis, I like the new ones and think all the other emojis should be redisgned Wow, if people were allowed to comment on other people's reviews... Well... I'd be dead...
