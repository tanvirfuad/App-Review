This is the best Job Search App by far Compare to any similar apps, this app is the best one. Its very direct to the point and very convenient to use and no BS. Good job to the Dev Team. I'm definitely gonna refer this app to my family, relatives and friends. More power to the Dev Team and keep up the awesomeness
Job searching has never been this easy would like the option to upload my resume I do not see that option makes it a little difficult because I would think an employee would like to see your resume some places require u to have a resume on file other than overall experience love the app I can apply to entry level jobs and get notified immediately of a upcoming interview via mobile phone all in one and receive call right after just wonderful awesome app
Found a Job Several months ago I used this app and with one click apply got an interview at a nice restaurant and am still working there to this day. Not sure about scams, I've found several jobs through the app.
