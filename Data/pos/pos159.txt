The app is OK. When I order knowing that it did not work the 1st three times, I just order and hit I'm here  before getting in me car. I count on the app to make sure my order is filled and that they have time to cook my empanadas and not have to wait long while I'm there. Especially on large orders
Taco Bell It's a wonderful app and even better if you live close by to taco bell and decide to order some taco before you go to school or other things that requires you leaving ur house. The only problem is that or i haven't seen yet taco bell delivers it to you, instead of going over their and picking it up possibly bc in lazy but i think that's an good idea to do.
Works perfectly fine Works just as described. Easy to customize your order and easy to use the promotions. I don't understand how people can't use the promos because they are EASY to use if you read the directions. Check in a couple minutes early to avoid the wait because your order will be in the order its received. If the store is busy, you'll be waiting. Your order will NOT be prioritized.
Easy... saved me 10 Downloaded it, signed in, went to offers and got 10 off a 20 order right away. I selected what I wanted and checked out with visa checkout option, it was ready right away. Its nice when something works like its supposed to.
