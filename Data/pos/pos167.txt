Very pleased. I am most importantly pleased with how I can communicate with my doctors and other staff. The Android version appears to me wellorganized.
You can absolutely send an email to your provider directly from this app from your home screen, click on the envelope, then for my android Galaxy S6 there is a plus sign in the bottom right corner for new message click there and that starts you through the new message.
Love This App I don't know how I ever lived without this app. I communicate with my docs  their staff easily  quickly. Have access to my test results as soon as the Doc gets them. Also have my med record wherever I go.
Communication This app makes it easy for me to tell my PCP about updates in my health without scheduling a visit. If the dentist or eye doctor or other specialists give me a diagnosis, I can tell my PCP, and they can update my chart.
Great app and useful I love the fact that I don't have to keep a lady of prescriptions when I viator the doctor, just check the app.  Easy to request appointment with the doc and send messages.
Handy I depend on my chart to remind me of Dr appointments also to refill my prescriptions. I get my meds refilled alot faster than calling the pharmacy.  I love my chart and everything it does
I like it It does what it was meant to do so for that I have no complaints
Works great I cannot be without it Love this app. I use it for me and my aging parents whom I take care of. Convenience of prescription renewals, doctor's questions  answers, appointments scheduling  reminders  more. Update THANK YOU FOR THE ADD TO CALENDAR FEATURE I HAD TO DO IT MANUALLY BEFORE  it took forever.
Great app Makes contacting my Dr so much easier
Love Getting better however, I wish I could reach links without having to go to main site.
Superb Yaaas.  Just don't able to pay a bill like you can on desktop.
Gotta keep up on my health Great app
