Very Useful As long as your provider actually uses it, it's amazing. I have two special needs children and this is the best way to keep up with everything Our medical life just got a LOT easier
Works well Once you figure out how to navigate its great. Really wish I could see the actual xrays and MRI images but everything else is great.
Very useful I forget a lot of things. But now my doc appointments won't be one.
