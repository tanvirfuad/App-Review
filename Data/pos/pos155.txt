Awesome We got 2 thermostats and 2 protects. They are better than expected,  house is lovely and warm when we want it. I also get notified when the missus is burning dinner she hates this.
Amazing software I use the nest cam as a baby monitor, alerts me of activity faster than anything I've ever used before.
Bit of a boring app, no issues The app splash is boring. Not sure what else you can do, just isn't a pleasing looking app to use. Functions perfectly, when I launch it, it doesn't seem like the same ui as the nest thermostat.
Love it Seems to work the way it should. Had to resend in our main unit and they overnighted it. The lady was very nice and helpful, I'll recommend nest just based on customer support alone.
Nest is the best I love that we get see what the temperature is in the house before we get home and adjust it as well, so it's warm or cool before we walk in the house.
I figure I have saved at least 20 every month since installing the nest 18mos ago
It just works Works as advertised The delay between app to unit is maybe 2 seconds when in WAN. Not even a second when on LAN. Notifications are great and meaningful.
It's works very well on my nexus 5 and 7.  I just have the nest thermostat gen 3.
Can't believe how much I love this I have no words.  Never thought a thermostat would make me so happy.    lying in bed oh it's too cold.  Pull out the phone... Fixed
Great No issues with my smoke detector or thermostat.  Nice to have control when you are away from home. I will update when I get a nest cam.
