Very Convenient Got a call wanting pizza, but I was not at home to do it online and take advantage of the deal. I downloaded the app which was a quick download. It didn't take up much space, and was actually able to be on my phone which is a problem I am currently having with other app. Easy to order just like at home online. Thanks. I actually rated an app, yep, pretty satisfied with this app.
Fixed All previous issues have been fixed. Automatically finds closest Hut to my GPS. Log in isn't an issue anymore. Sends my request immediately to the nearest Hut.,
Easy peasy lemon squeezy We got hingry. We wanted stuffed crust. We ordered. They delivered. Fat and happy food comma awaits. 
Ez I love the app. Simple, efficient and effective. Kind of weird at the end. I don't drink soda so you have to choose 2 liters of nothing
There is one tiny glitch going from the screen where I fill out my name and address to the payment screen. I have to click into one of the text boxes containing my already saved information and hit go when my keyboard comes up. Otherwise, this screen won't let me scroll up or down to where I can click to go to the next screen. This is a very slight inconvenience to an otherwise terrific app.
Simple enough Hungry.  Needed pizza.  Downloaded app. Made pizza online.  Showed up 20 mins later.  Hot. Fresh.  Made just right.  Friendly driver.  Will use again
