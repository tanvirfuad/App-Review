Great resource Love how detailed this app is.
Great app The app itself is unusually slow sometimes but it has the massive advantage of including the mechanism of drug action, something some of thE other aPps dOn't CaRe AT all to EsSentially include.
Huge improvement Totally worth the cost, so much better than the old app in every way. Fast, responsive, detailed, organized.
Awesome app Better than the free app that they had before.
Well Implemented This is night and day compared to the old Micromedex user interface. No more sluggishness or crashes
Awesome Really good, fast, organized. It's worthy 
Like it Just downloaded it, like what I see so far, will have to try it in ER tonight
Awesome app Very useful for fastpaced ED nursing.
