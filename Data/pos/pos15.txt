Very fast Downloads anything I throw at it.
Been waiting for this. I love that its mobile now.
Hell yeah Got tired of all the ads, so I bought Bittorrent pro. Love it I'll be real, it won't download every torrent. I think it depends on if the websites torrents are good. But it downloads a hell of a lot. Better than UTorrent any day, they don't even have a pro version. Lol You want a solid steady torrent downloader, Bittorrent baby, all the way
