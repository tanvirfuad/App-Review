It worked at a Mobile gas station I was able to redeem 800 pts. for 8 off my fill up.  I had the keyfob and just input the account number from it at the pump and it applied the discount.
Save more money Good way to save more money...doesn't stops us from saving using our existing card dealsoffers but is just an add on to save even more.  Saved around 10 each by shopping at Macy's, renting a car with Alamo and then buying HP laptop via Plenti online marketplace.
MACYS Macy's will give u a point for every dollar you spend...u spend 100 u get a hundred point, also they have triple point days and cosmetics you automatically get double points...earn a thousand points that's 10 back that u can use to redeem...I know Macy's can be pricey, but that's why u get a Macy's credit card...cuz them deals r really good Hit the clearance  Haha
Points I am trying to submit a question and it will not process. I need to know when my points go from PENDING to AVAILABLE
Great Idea Points turn into cash credit Great
I love it Great idea.. I love the fact that I can use earned points to purchase fuel
It's worth it Just saved 10 using plenti points on a Macy's purchase and that was on top of a 25 coupon I had. Normally you can't pile on coupons but it allowed it using Plenti points..
Plenti I will be happy when I earn some points
Points Used my points to pay my att bill
Love it I think it's a great card. I have saved over  25 on gas in just a few months. Easy to use swipe at pump then use  off. However I wish there were more stores that were involved.
