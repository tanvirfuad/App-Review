Love  It Its fun scratching off the cards getting points. The videos are super quick I am just playing for  the points towards a amazon gift card if I  win anything else that would be a bonus. Just turned in my saved tokens for my first 50 dollar amazon card yeaaa.
Get a job losers This app isn't meant to make you rich, it's just something to kill time
Seems like fun It seems like it's fun I'm just kinda wondering how long it is before you actually win something but it's fun trying lol
Love it Good way to get gift cards and fun you have to be patient somewhat  but still quicker than doing surveys for gift cards I already earned one
I love it even tho I can't win cash I can never win real cash so I'm a bit bumbed about that
Great app Upped it to 5 stars because I won again. Just got another Amazon card . It's my 5th or 6th .
Good app Lets you win prizes or tokens to get prizes you should install it
Awesome Good to kill time and earn rewards
